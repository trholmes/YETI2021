# Performance comparisons
I did a bit of comparing the performance and this is what I got. Python and C# are both scraping the webpage, while C++ and rust are just calculating the hashes and finding the string, so far
1. Rust 1.7 seconds
2. python 11.6 seconds
3. C# 11.2 seconds
4. C++ 30.1 seconds

The C++ version's poor performance is likely my use of strange formatting to get the result intended.
