# Day 3 Code instructions

I am once again using Julia and the Primes package. To add, open julia command line and type the following `using Pkg; Pkg.add("Primes")`. This will install and you can run my code. Also be sure to be using a Jupyter notebook running a julia kernel. Instructions for that are in previous instruction files.
